# Code Quiz :pencil:

## :label: Description
This is a Code Quiz that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## :scroll: Instructions
The quiz consists of a few code related questions. </br>
The user will create a name and take a timed quiz. </br>
Each correct answer sums 15 points to the score. </br>
Each wrong answer subtracts 10s from the timer. </br>
At the end of the quiz, the user will see their final score. </br>
The final score is calculated by summing the points acquired by answering the questions correctly and the time left.</br>
If the user's score is the new highest score, then the user's name and score will be shown in the Highest Score page.</br>
